            What is the composition of the universe?
        </p>
        <div class="explanation">
            <p> The universe is made up of three main componenets:
                <ul class="bullet">
                    <li> Dark matter - makes up 27% of the universe.</li>
                    <li> Dark energy - makes up 68% of the universe.</li>
                    <li> Visible matter - makes up 5% of the universe.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <hr />
        <div>
            <p> As of current, astronomers only have confirmed knowledge of 5% of the universe - visible/ordinary matter. </p>
            <h4> What we currently know of the universe: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Hubble’s law. States that the universe is constantly expanding, with the fabric of both space and time expanding in all directions. Hubble's law provides evidence for The Big Bang Theory. <br/> 
                 </li> 
                 <br/>
                 <li> The formation of stars: <br/> Star birth – Nebulae formed – made up of clouds of dust and gas (mainly hydrogen)- as dust and gas get closer together, gravitational collapse accelerates. Denser regions begin to form due to variations in the nebula. These regions gain mass and become denser as they pull in more dust and gas, increasing in temperature forming a protostar. Nuclear fusion activates to turn a protostar into a star.  </li> 
                 <br/>
                 <li>Star life- Once a star is formed, it remains in a stable equilibrium with a constant size. Gravitational forces act to compress the star, however, radiation pressure from photons emitted during fusion, gas pressure from nuclei in the core pushes outwards.</li>
                 <br/> 
                 <li> Using the evidence from Hubble's law and using the Doppler effect, it has been concluded that the distance of a celestial body- galaxies- away from earth is directly proportional to the velocity it is moving at. Galaxies which move away from Earth are 'red-shifted', wheras galaxies moving towards Earth are 'blue-shifted'.
                    </li> <br/>
                <li>How old is the universe? <br/> The universe itself is approximately 13.7 billion years old, where the universe expands space, cooling and the formation of matter. </li>
                
            </ul>

    <div class="darkenergy">
        <h3 class="heading"> Dark energy</h3>
        <p> Dark energy makes up the majority of the universe- what is it?</p>
        <br>
        <p> While both dark matter and dark energy have similar names, they are completely different. Dark energy is a theoretical resistant energy to gravity, which explains the increasing rate of the expansion of the universe. This 'dark energy' was discovered using the explosion of type 1a supernovas (white dwarfs) to measure the rate of expansion of the universe, dark energy was discovered in 1998. These findings opposed the thought that the expansion of the universe was to slow along with time due to intergalactic interactions of gravitational force<br/> Dark energy can be described as 'homogeneous' as it is evenly distributed throughout the galaxy and dark energy’s effect is not diluted from the expansion of the universe.  </p>
        <br/>
        <ul> The evidencing and theories behind dark energy:
            <li>Einsteins’ Theory of General Relativity predicted the composition of the universe being dynamic rather than static, thus adding a cosmological constant to oppose gravity. This resistance provided evidence for the existence of dark energy. Furthermore, Hubble provided evidence that the universe is expanding, which works in tandem to Einsteins’ theory. </li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <div>
            <p> Measurements of dark energy:
                <ul>
                    <li>Measurements surrounding dark energy concern the BOSS (the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey) which charts the distribution of galaxies. “Distribution has been proven to trace sound waves from the early Universe”. Using these distribution measurements, dark energy’s effects can be mapped 3-dimensionally with the help of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Data mapping from this instrument depicts dark energy’s effects on the expansion of the universe. This instrument must map out far (10 billion light years) in order to apprehend dark energies effects as from prior knowledge dark energy has a global effect on the universe (thus the effect expands throughout the whole of the universe). 
                        The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope observes and constrains the properties of both dark matter and dark energy.

        <h3 class="heading"> An introduction to particle physics</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What is anti-matter?  <br/>
Predicted by Paul Dirac in 1928, his theory provided evidence that every particle (organic matter) has its corresponding antiparticle (antimatter). If both particles meet, annihilation of both particles occur, converting the mass of each particle into pairs of photons. E.g. anti-particle of the electron (the positron).

                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>What is a fundamental particle? <br/>
    A particle which has no internal structure and thus cannot be divided into smaller sections. In this respect, dark matter is a fundamental particle, as it has no internal structure. Similarly, quarks are fundamental particles which make up organic matter such as protons and neutrons. Other fundamental particles include electrons and neutrinos. 
    </li>
        <br/>
        <li>What are the four fundamental forces in nature? <br/>
            Strong nuclear forces (effect nucleons), electromagnetic force (effects static and moving charged particles), weak nuclear forces (responsible for beta-decay), and gravitational forces (effects all particles with a mass).
            </li> <br/>
            <li>What particles do these forces effect? <br/>
                <ol><li>Hadrons – antiparticles and particles which are affected by strong nuclear forces and if charged, they also experience electromagnetic forces. They decay from weak nuclear force. Any particle which contains a quark is a hadron.</li>
               <li> Baryons - <br/>A baryon particle is a hadron containing 3 quarks. </li>
                <li>Mesons - <br/>  A meson particle is made up of both a quark and an anti-quark. </li>
                <li>Leptons- <br/>particles which aren’t affected by strong nuclear force. If charged they experience electromagnetic force.
                Both quarks and leptons are the building blocks of all matter- they’re fundamental particles.</li> 
                </ol></li>
                <li>What is the standard model?<br/>
                    A model which bases the theory in dealing with elementary particles and their interactions. Includes 6 quarks and 6 anti-quarks, each with a varying spin. <br/> - A mathematically consistent quantum field theory providing the description of visible matter of the universe, categorising leptons and quarks (fundamental matter), noting the interactions between them: electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear forces. Experiments that have been able to have been made from this theory include the use of particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider (located Geneva, Switzerland). The standard model also solved and discovered the masses of top quarks.
