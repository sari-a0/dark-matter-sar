      <h4>What do we know about dark matter?</h4>
      <p>There has proven to be different types of dark matter- but what is dark matter?</p>  <p>Dark Matter -  A hidden mass which holds the formation of galaxies together and structures the universe via the cosmic web. Guides the growth and distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. It doesn’t interact with light or electromagnetic radiation</p>
      <ul> <li> What are the types of dark matter? <br/> 
        There are multiple types of dark matter in relation to possible particle interactions, e.g. axion dark matter compared to a heavier particle dark matter (WIMPS). <br/> <br/> The first type of particle dark matter was said to be (WIMP) a weakly interacting massive particle e.g. massive neutrino. Another possibility of particle dark matter depicts the particle to be a low mass boson which would provide the characteristics of cold dark matter- populating the universe in a “coherent wave-like state” which is slow moving and hence cold. The axion itself is a prototype for dark matter in a wave-like state.
         </li> <br/> <li>
            While some believe dark matter does not interact with visible matter; Other theories suggest that dark matter can interact with dark matter, but very slowly and very weakly.<br/> <br/> Astrophysical observations infer dark matter’s existence from its effects on gravitational force, observations use the term “cold dark matter” to represent its slow movements throughout the history of the universe. In comparison to other cosmological findings, e.g. a star life, the movement of dark matter being slow relative to time in the universe suggests its effects are hard to decipher and difficult to prove in certainty.
         </li><br/> <li> How long has dark matter been present in the universe? <br/> Since the early universe: <br/>The evidence of dark matter’s existence in the early universe (i.e. time of the Big Bang) stems from cosmological observations such as galaxy clustering and temperature anisotropies (obtains a different value when measured in different directions) in cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). <br/> <br/> There is a possibility that dark matter was present in the universe before The Big Bang. </li></li>
        <br/> <li> What is the make-up of dark matter? <br/> The make-up of dark matter itself is ambiguous- possibilities are that it may consist of one or more types of fundamental particle, although part or even all of dark matter may consist of further invisible matter such as black holes. </li></ul>

        <li class="subheading">
             Dark Matter's Cosmic Density <ul>
                <li> 	(expressed as a fraction of the density of the entire universe) Dark matter makes up 26%, whereas ordinary (visible) matter makes up only 6%- this visible matter is what astronomers know for certain- and 68% is “vacuum” (dark) energy.</li>
                <li>Strong evidence from cosmic microwave background radiation</li>
            </ul>
        </li> <br/>
        <li class="subheading">
            Local density:
            <ul>
                <li>The local density of dark matter is withing the range of 0.3-0.4 GeV cm^-3, which is equivalent to one proton every few cubic metres/ one solar mass per cubic lightyear. The density of it on earth would be substantially different. This cosmic density range is important because it can be compared to other cosmic materials of similar densities that are known. </li>
                <li>	Strong evidence from Milky Way stellar motions.</li>

        <li class="subheading">
            Local velocity dispersion
            <ul>
                <li>The velocity dispersion (vector) of dark matter is approximately 200 km/s with the local motion in respect to the galactic rest frame is in the direction of the constellation Cygnus. Relates to the rate of expansion.</li>
                <li>Strong evidence obtained from Milky Way stellar motions</li>

        </li> <br/>
        <li class="subheading">
            <ul> Age of dark matter:
                <li>	Early appearance of dark matter, where dark matter has to already be both present and gravitating in the universe long before cosmic microwave background radiation formed, where its gravitational influence began before the universe was 1 years old. Thus, this suggests dark matter may be considered to be older than the Big Bang itself if it was present before it- thereby imposing the problem that astronomers have no certainty of what was before the big bang, if more evidence is proven to support the age of dark matter, the big bang theory may be disproved however that will disrupt the other findings of science. For light bosonic dark matter e.g. the axion, this corresponds to the latest epoch of particle creation.</li>

        <li class="subheading">
            <ul> Interactions of dark matter
                <li>
                    Lack of significant interactions as dark matter cannot interact with itself or ordinary (visible) matter too strongly. Suggests that it may be able to interact but only weakly.

        <li class="subheading"> Other properties of dark matter:
            <ul>
                <li>	Has no preferred galactic length scale, dark matter must be nonrelativistic- i.e. moving at such a slow pace it cannot be compared to the theory of relativity or to the speed of light). Dark matter also has a negligible pressure which would imprint sound waves during galaxy formation.</li>
                <li> Strong evidence from galaxy clustering and evolution</li>
            </ul>
        </li> <br/>
        <li class="subheading">
            <ul> How does galactic dark matter interact?
                <li>Dark matter has a mass which can be observed by its gravitational influence. All types of light passes through dark matter. Galactic dark matter resides in a halo surrounding ordinary matter. Dwarf galaxies (less bright thus harder to observe) contain a higher proportion of dark matter than their larger counterparts. <br/><br/>
                    Galaxy clusters contain thousands of galaxies, each with their own DM halo. However, each cluster itself has its own dark matter, outweighing everything else put together. Dark matter influences the movement of hot gas and individual galaxies move within the cluster. Astronomers determine the quantity and location of cluster dark matter by the way its gravity affects light via gravitational lensing.

     <h4> How do we know of dark matter and its existence?</h4><br>
     <ul><li> Celestial bodies such as galaxies rotate through the universe at such a speed that the gravity generated by their organic matter should in theory cause the galaxy to be torn apart. For galaxies to stay intact there must be extra mass in order to generate the extra gravitational force needed to withhold such a celestial body. This extra mass is dark matter. <br/> Using the Large Hadron Collider- located in Geneva, Switzerland- physicists could “infer dark matters’ existence from the amount of energy and momentum missing after a collision” as theories suggest dark matter particles would be light enough to be produced in the particle accelerator, however they’d remain undetected by detectors.</li><br/>
        </li>
    <li>How can we study dark matter? <br/>
        Using gravitational lensing, the effects dark matter has on gravitational forces can be observed via the warping and magnification of light (affected by this gravitational force). This provides an insight to multiple factors of dark matter’s effect including the density, quantity and distribution. 
         </li><br/> <li>What is the explanation of the existence of dark matter? <br/>
            Via the theory of theoretical particles including Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, which have predictable behaviours however their direct observations of their effects and by-products are extremely difficult.
