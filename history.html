         <p class="lead mb-4"><ul> <li>Using the Doppler Shift in the study of light in galaxies in the late 1970s, astronomers found that the velocity of celestial bodies in the vacuum of space (such as stars) did not correlate to the behaviours the astronomers expected. Their expectation was that the velocity would decrease as the distance from the centre of the galaxy increases. Thereby, this suggest that the anomalies the astronomers found were due to dark matter, as it suggest the mass is not conserved at the centre of the galaxy, contradicting what we can observe. Dark matter is distributed throughout each galaxy, holding a mass thus creating different concentrations of mass across the vacuum.</li><br/>
        <li>What instrument detects dark matter? <br/>
            Particle accelerators including the Large Hadron Collider (largest particle accelerator) detect WIMPS - Weakly Interactive Massive Particles-  (dark matter) 1970s- proposed supersymmetric WIMPs prospect causing the standard model to be questioned.. Recently, (2013) they also discovered the Higgs Boson molecules. The Higgs boson explains why all particles have a property of mass.
            </li><br/>
        <li>Evidence for dark matter has been accumulated since the 1930s. This brings forth the idea that the evidence of dark matter has been absolute and can be more reliable due to the fact it has been researched for nearly a century.  However, since dark matter is still in theory, it creates chance for conflicting theories to arise and possibly disprove the theory of dark matters’ existence. </li></ul></p>

            <div class="accordion-body">The Astronomer <bold class="bold">Fritz Zwicky</bold> discovered the presence of a non-visible matter by noticing the discrepancy between the quantity of visible matter and the correlation it has with the movement of galaxies. He noticed there was an anomaly with the interactions of gravity on visible matter. The article suggests that at a later point in time, more astronomers noticed the similar incongruities, proving Zwicky’s theoretical findings via peer-to-peer reviewing. They concluded that outer edges of galaxies rotate much faster than expected, suggesting dark matters influence.
                While dark matter does not emit, absorb or reflect light, its interaction with gravitational forces causes these forces to bend light from a background source from gravitational lensing techniques. The concluded rule was brought forth that when mass calculated from a bend of a galaxy doesn’t correlate to observable mass, dark matter is present and acting. Dark matter comprises 27% of the universe.
